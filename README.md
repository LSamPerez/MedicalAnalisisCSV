Program to determine some variables in a Medical Insurance CSV Document

This program was made to evalute the skills gained in Codecademy.

In a csv with data about different medical and personal variable to determine, I want to determine the main parameters to get a cheapest cost and know which parameter is the most important to avoid.

I found that be a smoker is the most important parameter to get a cheap charge, because all the people with highest cost are smokers.
